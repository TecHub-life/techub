# Minimal, open-source safe Kamal secrets.
# Only set what we truly need at deploy time.

# 1) GHCR token with packages:write (and read)
KAMAL_REGISTRY_PASSWORD=$KAMAL_REGISTRY_PASSWORD

# 2) Rails master key (read from file; do not export)
RAILS_MASTER_KEY=$(cat config/master.key)

# Notes:
# - Hosts are configured via WEB_HOSTS env (e.g. "techub-do").
# - JOB_HOSTS defaults to WEB_HOSTS in config/deploy.yml, so one var is enough.
# - Proxy host defaults to techub.life; override with APP_HOST if you need a different domain.
