# TecHub

**AI-powered collectible trading cards for GitHub developer profiles**

Part discovery engine, part vibe board, part trading card game for builders.

Created by **Jared Hooker ([@GameDevJared89](https://github.com/jrh89))** and **Dean Lofts

## TecHub Showcase

Each card is automatically created using **GitHub profile data, repositories, contributions, stars,
issues, PRs,** and linked content. The result: a stylised, high-signal snapshot of **who you are,
what you build, and why you matter**.

---

## How It Works

1. **Free Submission (GitHub signal check)** Submit any GitHub username for free. We run an
   eligibility check (age, repos, followers, activity) to keep bots out and make sure there's enough
   public signal to build a meaningful card.

2. **AI-Powered Generation** Our pipeline analyses profile signals (repos, commits, languages,
   topics) and linked content to generate **attack & defence stats, buffs, weaknesses, special
   moves,** and **tech-stack tags**.

3. **Directory Entry & API** Your card joins the searchable directory and is available via the
   **TecHub API**. Discover profiles by **languages, stacks, vibes,** and **styles**. Build with the
   data.

4. **Collectible Cards & Merch** The first **52 profiles** will form a limited-edition physical deck
   — printed, numbered, and available to buy — turning open-source presence into real-world
   collectibles.

## Why GitHub Eligibility?

Staying free means we vet accounts instead of charging. Eligibility scoring looks at GitHub signal —
account age, repository depth, social proof, and recent activity — so we spend AI budget on genuine
builders. Miss the mark? Grow your footprint, come back, and we’ll pick it up from there.

## The Vision

collection. For **developers, maintainers, founders, tool builders,** and **innovators**. If you’ve
got signal to share, you belong in the deck.
