## New Services

### `Github::FetchPinnedReposService`

Fetches pinned repositories using GitHub's GraphQL API. Returns detailed information about up to 6
pinned repositories including:

- Name, description, URL
- Star and fork counts
- Primary language
- Topics/tags
- Owner information
- Timestamps

## Rake Tasks

### Refresh Profile Data

```bash
bin/rails profiles:refresh[username]
```

Deletes and re-syncs a profile with fresh GitHub data.

### Refresh All Profiles

```bash
bin/rails profiles:refresh_all
```

Refreshes all profiles in the database.

## Testing

Added comprehensive tests for:

- `FetchPinnedReposService`
- Updated `ProfileSummaryService` tests to include new methods

All tests pass successfully.

## API Usage

The service now makes additional API calls:

1. GitHub REST API for user and repositories (existing)
2. GitHub GraphQL API for pinned repositories (new)
3. GitHub REST API for active repository details (new)

## Next Steps

Consider:

1. Adding caching to reduce API calls
2. Implementing pagination for repositories
3. Adding more filters (e.g., by language, topic)
4. Rendering README as proper Markdown with syntax highlighting
5. Adding repository contribution graphs
6. Showing repository activity timeline
