We need to tape off the image generation and image descriptions because we don't need them for profile generation anymore. I will replace this with our own pre-existing image assets. We will have the user's github avatar which we pull in, some avatar images they can select, and we will have supporting art that they can select. We won't generate AI art, but we want to leave the capability in case we want to make this a paid account feasture later on. If we try to generate images or get an image description, instead of actually doing it, it should return the message that we aren't doing it and why. We don't want to break any existing code though. We follow SOLID and I expect that if I want to come back that it will work correctly.

At the moment we have image generation, image descriptions, structured text output and we should have standard text output. These should be stand alone services. What we have now works perfectly and we can NOT break it. We have to prove any changes we make IF we make changes. I am hoping we don't have to.

For the development environment, we want a flag that defaults to off for Gemini. In development we don't actually need or want the real AI stuff. We arne't going to change the way the text works from how it is now. At least not the fields and what data is in them. We might change the prompts but that is about it.

AI generated avatar functionality, which is part of our current pipeline should remain there but it should be taped off because we don't want the user to be able to get it anymore, and they will have their default GitHub avatar, and the pre-defined avatars that we give them. They will still be able to select them in settings.

AI generated supporting artwork is the same, and we want to tape it off, but not kill the functionality, in case we want to make this a paid account feature later on. We will replace this with a pre-defined library of supporting artwork that they can select, in place of the AI generated artwork.

We need to move the art we generated from the archetypes and spirit animals, and the lore we had (I think that is in our DB now anyway) into our repository and in the application so it will be available in the image. Generating this programatically was cool but kinda stupid and we need to tape it off. Costs again. Users can probably use this artwork for their avatars too, so we will have a few to select from. This is currently in object storage if it doesn't exist on disk already. It is in a directory we don't push to git and that needs to change. It should be in our image. Let's move it somewhere suitable.

We will still generate the profiles with AI, but it will be limited to the text, which is existing now and in place and works.

We want to whitelist the accounts that are allowed to be used. Only loftwah and jrh89 should be able to sign in, and if any other profile signs in it should tell them they can't because they are not on the list, and that we are not open yet. We want this visible and able to be managed from the ops panel. We should also have a way to open the floodgates. If we turn this on/off it should persist between deployments too. I guess it would default to off, but once we open it, the next deployment shouldn't turn it off.

I have added the premade avatars to app/assets/images/avatars-1x1 and they are all 1024x1024 (all art is this size for now and we just have to work with it as best we can) supporting art is app/assets/images/supporting-art-1x1
